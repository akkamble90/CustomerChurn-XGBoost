# Customer Churn Prediction using XGBoost

## Project Description
This is a **supervised machine learning project** that predicts customer churn for a business.  
The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave (`Churn = 1`) versus those who stay (`Churn = 0`).  

The project uses the **XGBoost classifier**, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm based on decision trees.  
It includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization of feature importance.

## Dataset
- The dataset should be a CSV file (e.g., `customer_churn.csv`).  
- Make sure it is in the same folder as the script or uploaded in Google Colab if running there.  

## How to Run

### Locally
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
